How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
-It narrowed the scope of stuff I had to look through


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
-It can make you less hesitant when it comes to major overhauls of code for the
sake of efficiency.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google Docs does?
-Pros: won't commit something that won't compile; won't commit in the middle of
a fix; commits are logical
Cons: May screw something up, forgetting to commit, so you don't have a copy of
good changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-Git log will give you a list of commit IDs/details, that you can then use git
diff in the format "git diff old_file new_file" to show changes.

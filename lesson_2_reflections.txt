What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-It creates a git project that you will be able to commit to. It sets up all the
meta data and stuff.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
-Staging area is all the files that you are about to commit. Working directory
is all the files in the directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
-Use 'git status' to check what's in your staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
-Maybe you want to branch off to create an easy mode of a game you're designing
or to try some experimental feature.
